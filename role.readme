---

## 1) Finn
- Initial: `🔍2 💰0 ❤️3 📦0 👑0 🤴🏻0`
- Draw cost: `THEN / stamina-1 | curiosity-1` (auto takes first payable option).
- Skill: ask one player with orange item; if accepted, Finn wears `+1` orange and gains `⭐️+1`.
- Win: wear `3` orange items (`🤴🏻 >= 3`).
- Auto strategy (synced to game logic):
  - Turn choice: prefer `Use Skill`; if no skill value, then `Draw`.
  - Draw payment: normally pay `❤️`; switch to `🔍` when `❤️ <= 1`.
  - Target selection: prioritize players closest to winning; tie-break by lower orange stock.
  - Consent policy: if another player asks Finn-side consent to help Finn wear, default `Refuse` when refusal is allowed.
  - Watching performance:
    - Prefer to watch if it can trigger wear (`👑 -> 🤴🏻`) or if `🔍 <= 1`.
    - Prefer paying watch cost by `💰`, fallback to `🔍`.
  - Card choices:
    - Prefer choices that convert current `👑` into worn progress until `🤴🏻=3`.

## 2) Tourist

  - Valid photo only if target is wearing orange (`🤴🏻 > 0`), then tourist gains `⭐️+1`.
- Win: `3` valid photos (same tourist can photo Finn only once).
- Auto strategy (synced to game logic):
